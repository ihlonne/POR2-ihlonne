    description:
      'Evergreen is a small front-end project built to demonstrate the use of a modern CSS framework in a responsive layout. The goal was to apply Tailwind CSS effectively by following documentation, structuring styles for scalability, and ensuring consistent design across different screen sizes. The app mimics a minimal social media concept with three pages â€” an authentication page with form validation, a feed displaying posts with search and sort features, and a user profile page with a follower section. This assignment emphasized planning responsive design, maintaining clean class structures, and working with npm scripts for both development and production builds. Although a lightweight project, Evergreen served as a hands-on exercise in practical framework usage and UI consistency.',
